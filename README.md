### Run pyminer-Google-Colab

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HRmOUlGrtB8lO71lypfZc-LaVzj0FHEz?usp=sharing

-------------------------

This is a 'getwork' CPU mining client for bitcoin.

It is pure-python, and therefore very, very slow.  The purpose is to
provide a reference implementation of a miner, for study.

##In order for this software to run you must build and run bitcoind from source on your computer.
